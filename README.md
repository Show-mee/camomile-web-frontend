# Camomile Webapp

To configure and start the server, issue:

$ npm install
$ node web-server.js

The webapp can then be called at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
It assumes the REST API is located at http://localhost:3000 - this may be changed by modifying the service property "RESTroot", in app/js/services.js.
